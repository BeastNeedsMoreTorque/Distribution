## Comments

These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
/**
 * Core types per the [ReactiveStreams specification](http://www.reactive-streams.org/)
 */
/**
 * Represents an asynchronous, pull-based stream of values. Calling
 * `subscribe()` causes the subscriber's `onSubscribe()` method to be be invoked
 * with a Subscription object that has two methods:
 * - `cancel()`: stops the publisher from publishing any more values.
 * - `request(n)`: requests `n` additional values.
 *
 * The subscriber can use `request(n)` to pull additional values from the
 * stream.
