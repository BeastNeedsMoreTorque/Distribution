// Type definitions for RSVP 4.0
// Project: https://github.com/tildeio/rsvp.js
// Definitions by: Chris Krycho <https://github.com/chriskrycho>
//                 Mike North <https://github.com/mike-north>
// Definitions: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped
// TypeScript Version: 2.4
// These types are derived in large part from the Microsoft-supplied types for
// ES2015 Promises. They have been tweaked to support RSVP's extensions to the
// Promises A+ spec and the additional helper functions it supplies.
