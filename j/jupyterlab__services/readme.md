## Comments

These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
/**
 * The namespace for ServerConnection functions.
 *
 * #### Notes
 * This is only intended to manage communication with the Jupyter server.
 *
 * The default values can be used in a JupyterLab or Jupyter Notebook context.
 *
 * We use `token` authentication if available, falling back on an XSRF
 * cookie if one has been provided on the `document`.
 *
 * A content type of `'application/json'` is added when using authentication
 * and there is no body data to allow the server to prevent malicious forms.
