These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
// Type definitions for WebVR API
// Project: https://w3c.github.io/webvr/
// Definitions by: efokschaner <https://github.com/efokschaner>
// Definitions: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped
// Typescript doesn't allow redefinition of type aliases even if they match,
// thus the _dt_alias to signal this being an alias for the use of DefinitelyTyped
