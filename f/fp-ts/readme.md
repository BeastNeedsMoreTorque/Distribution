 * Instances must satisfy the following laws:

 * - Commutative monoid under addition:

 *   - Identity: `zero + a = a + zero = a`
 *   - Commutative: `a + b = b + a`
 * - Monoid under multiplication:
 *   - Associativity: `(a * b) * c = a * (b * c)`

 * - Multiplication distributes over addition:
 *   - Left distributivity: `a * (b + c) = (a * b) + (a * c)`
