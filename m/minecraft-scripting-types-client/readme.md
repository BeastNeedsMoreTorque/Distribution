## Comments

These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
/**
     * The MoLang component gives access to the MoLang variables in an entity. To learn more about MoLang varibles review the add-on documentation. In scripts, you can get and set these varibles that are defined in the entity's JSON files. Because of how the MoLang variables are formatted (entity.isgrazing for example) you must use the [] operator on the object to access the variable. The example below shows how to use the [] operator to access the variable.
