 */
/**
 * Return quadratic length of a vector.
 */
/**
 * Return value interpolated between x and y.
 */

 */
/**
 * Get order of magnitude for a number.
 */
/**
 * Get precision from float:
 */
/**
 * Rounds value to optional step.
 */
/**
 * Get first scale out of a list of basic scales, aligned to the power. E. g.
 * step(.37, [1, 2, 5]) → .5 step(456, [1, 2]) → 1000
 * Similar to closest, but takes all possible powers of scales.

 * Whether element is between left & right, including.
