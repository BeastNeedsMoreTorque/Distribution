// Type definitions for Google Realtime API
// Project: https://developers.google.com/google-apps/realtime/
// Definitions by: Dustin Wehr <http://cs.toronto.edu/~wehr>
// Definitions: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped
// This definition file is merge-compatible with ../gapi/gapi.d.ts
// Note the occurrences of "INCOMPLETE". For some interfaces and object types, I have only included
// the properties and methods that I've actually used so-far, and will add more as they become useful to me.
// Or, maybe you want to complete them?
// For Typescript newbs: To get shorter names, use e.g.
//   type CollabModel = gapi.drive.realtime.Model;
//   interface CollabList<T> extends gapi.drive.realtime.CollaborativeList<T> {}
// See section "Type Aliases" of http://www.typescriptlang.org/Content/TypeScript%20Language%20Specification.pdf
// gapi is a global var introduced by https://apis.google.com/js/api.js
