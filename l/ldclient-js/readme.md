These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
/**
 * This is the API reference for the LaunchDarkly SDK for browser JavaScript.
 *
 * In typical usage, you will call [[initialize]] once at startup time to obtain an instance of
 * [[LDClient]], which provides access to all of the SDK's functionality.
 *
 * For more information, see the [SDK reference guide](http://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/js-sdk-reference).
