 * Returns a logger with the specified name, creating it if a logger with that name does not already exist.
 * If no name is specified, a logger is returned with name [anonymous], and subsequent calls to getLogger()
 * (with no logger name specified) will return this same logger object.
 * Note that the names [anonymous], [default], [null] and root are reserved for the anonymous logger, default logger,
 * null logger and root logger respectively.
