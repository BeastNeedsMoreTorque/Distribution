// KeyboardJS is a library for use in the browser (node.js compatible).
// It Allows developers to easily setup key bindings. Use key combos to setup complex bindings.
// KeyboardJS also provides contexts. Contexts are great for single page applications.
// They allow you to scope your bindings to various parts of your application.
// Out of the box keyboardJS uses a US keyboard locale. If you need support for
// a different type of keyboard KeyboardJS provides custom locale support so you can create
// with a locale that better matches your needs.
