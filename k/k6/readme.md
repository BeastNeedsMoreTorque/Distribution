/*
 * Uses a branding pattern throughout to reflect the custom classes exposed by
 * the k6 runtime. These classes have internal state not visible in JavaScript.
 * The object passed back to k6 must be an actual instance created on the
 * golang side. Duck typed objects are not safe.
 *
 * Each class includes a protected property __brand: never. The brand breaks
 * duck typing for noninstances with an identical public shape.
 *
 * This follows the pattern used in the TypeScript compiler:
