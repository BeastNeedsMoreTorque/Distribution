 *
 * Removal of Nes.Server.  No longer need to cast to Nes.Server as Hapi.Server
 *      has been modified directly.
 * Removal of Nes.Request.  Same reason as Nes.Server
 * Move Nes.Socket from class to just an interface as it is not mentioned
 *      publically in docs.  Perhaps this should be included though?  Add
 *      failing test demonstrating use if so.
