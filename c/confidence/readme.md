/**
* Confidence is a configuration document format, an API, and a foundation for A/B testing.
* The configuration format is designed to work with any existing JSON-based configuration,
* serving values based on object path ('/a/b/c' translates to a.b.c). In addition,
* confidence defines special $-prefixed keys used to filter values for a given criteria.
