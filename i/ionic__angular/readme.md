/**
 * @description
 * NavParams are an object that exists on a page and can contain data for that particular view.
 * Similar to how data was pass to a view in V1 with `$stateParams`, NavParams offer a much more flexible
 * option with a simple `get` method.
 *
 * @usage
 * ```ts
 * import { NavParams } from '@ionic/angular';
 *
 * export class MyClass{
 *
 *  constructor(navParams: NavParams){
 *    // userParams is an object we have in our nav-parameters
 *    navParams.get('userParams');
 *  }
 *
 * }
 * ```
 */
