/**
 * This package aims to provide a way to format different variations of relative time.
 * You can use this package in the browser and on the server via Node.js.
 *
 * This implementation is very similar to moment.js, in concept, although it provides
 * only formatting features based on the Unicode CLDR locale data, an industry
 * standard that supports more than 200 languages.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/yahoo/intl-relativeformat
