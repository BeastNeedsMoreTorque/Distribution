```
/** Alignment along the horizontal axis. */
/** Boundary of a one-dimensional interval. */
/**
 * Generic interface defining constructor types, such as classes. This is used to type the class
 * itself in meta-programming situations such as decorators.
 */
/**
 * The four basic intents.
 */
/**
 * Safely invoke the member function with no arguments, if the object
 * exists and the given key is indeed a function, and return its value.
 * Otherwise, return `undefined`.
 */
