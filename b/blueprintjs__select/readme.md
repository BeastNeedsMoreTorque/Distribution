/**
 * Customize querying of entire `items` array. Return new list of items.
 * This method can reorder, add, or remove items at will.
 * (Supports filter algorithms that operate on the entire set, rather than individual items.)
 *
 * If defined with `itemPredicate`, this prop takes priority and the other will be ignored.
