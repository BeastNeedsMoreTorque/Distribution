// Type definitions for tern 0.23
// Project: https://github.com/ternjs/tern
// Definitions by: Nikolaj Kappler <https://github.com/nkappler>
// Definitions: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped
// TypeScript Version: 2.8
// IMPORTANT Note: These type definitions adhere strictly to the official documentation,
// which does not seem to match the implementation exactly in some places.
// As a result, these type definitions may lack some parts of the API that are actually exposed.
// The type definitions are at a point where they are usable and match the documentation,
// thus if you want to use undocumented APIs, you should extends these definitions with
// ambient declaration merging: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/declaration-merging.html
