    * renew it fails and `canceled` or `unpaid` (depending on your subscriptions settings)

    * paid by the due date, and `canceled` or `unpaid` if it is still not paid by an
    * additional deadline after that. Note that when a subscription has a status of
    * `unpaid`, no subsequent invoices will be attempted (invoices will be created, but
    * then immediately automatically closed). After receiving updated payment information
    * from a customer, you may choose to reopen and pay their closed invoices.
