// Release comments:
// -----------------
// The audio analysis object is not yet in the Object Model at Spotify, therefore it is typed as any in this file.
// TrackObjects and AlbumObjects is specified in the docs as always having the available_markets property,
// but when it is sent in https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-current-user-saved-tracks
// the available_markets are missing. Therefore it is marked as optional in this source code.
