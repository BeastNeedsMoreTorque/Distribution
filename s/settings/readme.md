## Comments

These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
// Type definitions for settings 0.1
// Project: https://github.com/mgutz/node-settings
// Definitions by: Shrey Jain <https://github.com/shreyjain1994>
// Definitions: https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped
// TypeScript Version: 2.2
// This wierd looking class definition is necessary since the function that the module
// exposes NEEDS (will throw error otherwise) to be called with the `new` keyword
// BUT returns a random object...not an instance of the class

```
