       *   A phrase is a pattern of musical events over time,
       *   i.e. a series of notes and rests. Phrases must be
       *   added to a p5.Part for playback, and each part can
       *   play multiple phrases at the same time. For
       *   example, one Phrase might be a kick drum, another
       *   could be a snare, and another could be the
       *   bassline.
       *
       *   The first parameter is a name so that the phrase
       *   can be modified or deleted later. The callback is
       *   a a function that this phrase will call at every
       *   stepâ€”for example it might be called
       *   playNote(value){}. The array determines which
       *   value is passed into the callback at each step of
       *   the phrase. It can be numbers, an object with
       *   multiple numbers, or a zero (0) indicates a rest
       *   so the callback won't be called).
       *
       *   @param name Name so that you can access the
       *   Phrase.
       *   @param callback The name of a function that this
       *   phrase will call. Typically it will play a sound,
       *   and accept two parameters: a time at which to play
       *   the sound (in seconds from now), and a value from
       *   the sequence array. The time should be passed into
       *   the play() or start() method to ensure precision.
       *   @param sequence Array of values to pass into the
       *   callback at each step of the phrase.
