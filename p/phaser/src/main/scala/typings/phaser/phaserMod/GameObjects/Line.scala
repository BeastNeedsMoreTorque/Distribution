/**
  * The Line Shape is a Game Object that can be added to a Scene, Group or Container. You can
  * treat it like any other Game Object in your game, such as tweening it, scaling it, or enabling
  * it for input or physics. It provides a quick and easy way for you to render this shape in your
  * game without using a texture, while still taking advantage of being fully batched in WebGL.
  * 
  * This shape supports only stroke colors and cannot be filled.
  * 
  * A Line Shape allows you to draw a line between two points in your game. You can control the
  * stroke color and thickness of the line. In WebGL only you can also specify a different
  * thickness for the start and end of the line, allowing you to render lines that taper-off.
  * 
  * If you need to draw multiple lines in a sequence you may wish to use the Polygon Shape instead.
  * 
  * Be aware that as with all Game Objects the default origin is 0.5. If you need to draw a Line
  * between two points and want the x1/y1 values to match the x/y values, then set the origin to 0.
