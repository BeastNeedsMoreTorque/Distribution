/**
 * Podium
 * Node (semi) compatible event emitter with extra features.
 * podium is an event emitter with support for tags, filters, channels, event update cloning, arguments spreading, and other features useful when building large scale applications. While node's native EventEmitter is strictly focused on maximum performance, it lacks many features that do not belong in the core implementation. podium is not restricted by node's performance requirement as it is designed for application layer needs where it's overhead is largely insignificant as implementing these features will have similar cost on top of the native emitter.
