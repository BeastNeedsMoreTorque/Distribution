## Comments

These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
/**
 * Note about the naming of generics:
 *
 * - `T`: Use when there is only one generic input parameter.
 * - `R`: End result of the function / pipe.
 * - `R<number>`: Result of the nth function inside the pipe that is passed to the (n+1)-th function.
 */

/**
 * Function which accepts one parameter. Expected to return a `Promise` or value.
 *
 * @param value - First parameter.
 */
