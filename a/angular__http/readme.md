 * The only known difference between this `Headers` implementation and the spec is the

 * ### Example
 *
 * ```
 * import {Headers} from '@angular/http';
 *
 * var firstHeaders = new Headers();
 * firstHeaders.append('Content-Type', 'image/jpeg');
 * console.log(firstHeaders.get('Content-Type')) //'image/jpeg'
 *
 * // Create headers from Plain Old JavaScript Object
 * var secondHeaders = new Headers({
 *   'X-My-Custom-Header': 'Angular'
 * });
 * console.log(secondHeaders.get('X-My-Custom-Header')); //'Angular'
 *
 * var thirdHeaders = new Headers(secondHeaders);
 * console.log(thirdHeaders.get('X-My-Custom-Header')); //'Angular'
