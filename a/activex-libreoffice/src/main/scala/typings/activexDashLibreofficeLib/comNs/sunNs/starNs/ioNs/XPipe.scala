/**
  * The implementation of an output stream and an input stream.
  *
  * All data written through the outputstream is buffered until it is read again from the input stream. Often two different threads access input and
  * outputstream.
  *
  * With the pipe-service, an outputstream can be converted into an input stream at the cost of an additional buffer.
