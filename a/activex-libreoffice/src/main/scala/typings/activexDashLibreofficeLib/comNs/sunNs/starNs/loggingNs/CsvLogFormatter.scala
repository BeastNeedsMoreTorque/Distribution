/**
  * specifies a service which formats log records for RFC4180-style CSV-Files
  *
  * Every log record, as passed to {@link XCsvLogFormatter.format()} , will be formatted into a single row for a CSV file. The sequence number, the thread
  * ID, the time of the logged event, the source class/method name will get logged alongside the message, if this is not disabled. The Formatter also
  * supports logging an arbitrary number of user-defined columns. If the Formatter is configured to have more than one (user-defined) column the data to
  * log has to be preformatted with the formatMultiColumn method.
  * @since OOo 3.0
