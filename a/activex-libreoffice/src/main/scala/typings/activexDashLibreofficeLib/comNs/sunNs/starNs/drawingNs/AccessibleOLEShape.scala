/**
  * The {@link AccessibleOLEShape} service is implemented by OLE shapes.
  *
  * This includes generic OLE shapes, frames, plug-ins, and applets.
  *
  * This service supports the additional {@link com.sun.star.accessibility.XAccessibleAction} interface.
  *
  * OLE objects are handled as place holders. While not activated the accessible OLE shape is the only indicator of the OLE object's existence. When an
  * OLE object has been activated then the accessibility tree representing it (as far as that is available) is included directly under the accessible
  * document view and not under the OLE object. This is due to underlying implementation constraints and may change in the future.
  * @since OOo 1.1.2
