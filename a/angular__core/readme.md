/**
 * Base class for Angular Views, provides change detection functionality.
 * A change-detection tree collects all views that are to be checked for changes.
 * Use the methods to add and remove views from the tree, initiate change-detection,
 * and explicitly mark views as _dirty_, meaning that they have changed and need to be rerendered.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 *
 * The following examples demonstrate how to modify default change-detection behavior
 * to perform explicit detection when needed.
 *
 * ### Use `markForCheck()` with `CheckOnce` strategy
 *
 * The following example sets the `OnPush` change-detection strategy for a component
 * (`CheckOnce`, rather than the default `CheckAlways`), then forces a second check
 * after an interval. See [live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/GC512b?p=preview).
 *
 * <code-example path="core/ts/change_detect/change-detection.ts"
 * region="mark-for-check"></code-example>
 *
 * ### Detach change detector to limit how often check occurs
 *
 * The following example defines a component with a large list of read-only data
 * that is expected to change constantly, many times per second.
 * To improve performance, we want to check and update the list
 * less often than the changes actually occur. To do that, we detach
 * the component's change detector and perform an explicit local check every five seconds.
 *
 * <code-example path="core/ts/change_detect/change-detection.ts" region="detach"></code-example>
 *
 *
 * ### Reattaching a detached component
 *
 * The following example creates a component displaying live data.
 * The component detaches its change detector from the main change detector tree
 * when the `live` property is set to false, and reattaches it when the property
 * becomes true.
 *
 * <code-example path="core/ts/change_detect/change-detection.ts" region="reattach"></code-example>

 * To create a Pipe, you must implement this interface.
 *
 * Angular invokes the `transform` method with the value of a binding
 * as the first argument, and any parameters as the second argument in list form.
 *
 * @usageNotes
 * ### Example
 *
 * The `RepeatPipe` below repeats the value as many times as indicated by the first argument:
 *
 * ```
 * import {Pipe, PipeTransform} from '@angular/core';
 *
 * @Pipe({name: 'repeat'})
 * export class RepeatPipe implements PipeTransform {
 *   transform(value: any, times: number) {
 *     return value.repeat(times);
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

 *
 * Original: 'div[attr1]:not(.foo[attr2])
 * Parsed: [
 *  'div', 'attr1', '',
 *  SelectorFlags.NOT | SelectorFlags.ATTRIBUTE 'attr2', '', SelectorFlags.CLASS, 'foo'
 * ]
