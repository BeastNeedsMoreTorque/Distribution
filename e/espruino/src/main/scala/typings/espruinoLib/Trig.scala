/**
* <p>This class exists in order to interface Espruino with fast-moving trigger wheels. Trigger wheels are physical discs with evenly spaced teeth cut into them, and often with one or two teeth next to each other missing. A sensor sends a signal whenever a tooth passed by, and this allows a device to measure not only RPM, but absolute position.</p>
* <p>This class is currently in testing - it is NOT AVAILABLE on normal boards.</p>
