## Comments

These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
/**
 * The namespace's name is the same as the exported EggCookies,
 * so you can solely use CookieGetOptions and CookieSetOptions
 * when you use
 * `import {CookieGetOptions, CookieSetOptions} from 'egg-cookies'`.
 */

```
