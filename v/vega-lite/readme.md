## Comments

These comments are from the typescript definitions and might be useful:
```
/**
 * Generic class for storing properties that are explicitly specified
 * and implicitly determined by the compiler.
 * This is important for scale/axis/legend merging as
 * we want to prioritize properties that users explicitly specified.
 */
/**
 * @minimum 1
 * @maximum 12
 * @TJS-type integer
 */
/**
 * Vega-Lite's singleton logger utility.
 */
