    * The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub has started a background job to compute the mergeability. After giving the job time to complete, resubmit the request. When the job finishes, you will see a non-`null` value for the `mergeable` attribute in the response. If `mergeable` is `true`, then `merge_commit_sha` will be the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.

Before merging a pull request, the `merge_commit_sha` attribute holds the SHA of the _test_ merge commit.

    *
    * *   If merged as a [merge commit](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/), `merge_commit_sha` represents the SHA of the merge commit.

    * *   If [rebased](https://help.github.com/articles/about-merge-methods-on-github/#rebasing-and-merging-your-commits), `merge_commit_sha` represents the commit that the base branch was updated to.

    * The value of the `mergeable` attribute can be `true`, `false`, or `null`. If the value is `null`, then GitHub has started a background job to compute the mergeability.
